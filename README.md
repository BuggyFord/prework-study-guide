- My motivation was to gain new skills to move forward in my career and life. 
- To accomplish this I used the prework study guide to build and to establish a solid foudation of the necesarry skills tools and sofware to begin my education in what will be my new career. 
- In turn I was able to solve many problems and challenges along the way , from how to open my terminal to building the rudimentary webpage.
